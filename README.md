# Data Engineering Zoomcamp - Personal Implementation

This repository contains my implementation and learning progress from the [DataTalks.Club Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp), a comprehensive course covering modern data engineering practices and tools.

## 📋 Course Overview

The Data Engineering Zoomcamp is a free, community-driven course that covers:
- Data pipelines and orchestration
- Containerization with Docker
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Data warehousing
- Analytics engineering
- Stream processing

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build end-to-end data pipelines
- Learn industry-standard tools and practices
- Create a portfolio project demonstrating data engineering skills
- Share knowledge and best practices
